# SuiMoveScratch

**No-Code Move Module Explorer & Editor for the Sui Blockchain**

SuiMoveScratch is a visual no-code tool that helps developers and learners explore, edit, and understand Move smart contracts deployed on the Sui blockchain. It transforms Move code into editable UI components — making the learning curve smoother and the development experience friendlier.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BlockBlockYonsei/SuiMoveScratch.git

## How It Works

1. The app loads a JSON file (`move_source_code.json`) representing a Move module
2. It parses the JSON and renders UI blocks for each element
3. Users can:
   - View, understand, and interact with existing structs/functions
   - Add new components using no-code dialogs
   - Visualize all elements in a structured sidebar and list view
